## Heaven is a place where nothing ever ever happens

My digital archives has more frequently taken on the role of a duty to oversee and safeguard, rather than the site of deep reflection and insight I had hoped. Digital media is effectively static, unchanged by the passing of time. Traditional mediums patina, yellow, curl and decompose with time in ways familiar and often revered and comforting.

## Current research

As part of an ongoing exploration I have been attempting to address the stasis of my archive through the digital analogs of an alchemic process. In a most recent effort I've processed the images and videos through an algorithmic approximation of the first four stages: burning, dissolving, separating, re-combining, and fermenting.

## Initial results

The ultimate is to generate artifacts that both effectively honor my past experience, and present me with new synthesized artifacts which aid me in integrating past experience in ways familiar to memory formation in our psyche.

### Initial experiment: Choose a random color channel (Red, Green, or Blue) from 3  randomly choosen single frame from any video during this period, and the create a new RGB frame with the results. Output that as an image.

Through the random selection of frames from videos spanning the last four years, followed by their recombination, I discovered a result that surpassed mere randomness. Each frame, drawn from various videos, carried a unique charge. While the resultant abstract collages may appear arbitrary or abstract to the viewer, to me, each combination is infused with profound suggestion. This initial exploration has opened a door to a realm where the alchemy of digital media becomes a conduit for meaningful and personal metamorphosis.
