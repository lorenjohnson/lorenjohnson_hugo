summary: "As part of ongoing research I've been experimenting with digital analogs of an alchemic processes to transform my digital archives into something more dynamic, and subjected to the passing of time. In this most recent effort I've processed the images and videos through an algorithmic approximation of the first four stages of that process: burning, dissolving, separating, re-combining, and fermenting."

## Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens

Digital media remains effectively static and unchanged by the passing of time, while traditional media patinas, yellows, curls and decomposes in familiar and comforting ways.

In part due to this quality and in part to the available tooling, interacting with my personal digital archive has felt more often like management than an immersion in reflection and insight which I otherwise wish it to be.

## Current research

I've been experimenting with digital analogs of an alchemic processes to transform these materials into something once again dynamic and re-subjected to the fourth dimension. In this most recent effort I've been processing my videos through an algorithmic approximation of the first four stages of that process: burning, dissolving, separating, re-combining, and fermenting. 

Ultimately the attempt is to recombine, transform, and re-present the artefacts in ways which aid me in better understanding and integrating the past. I've been rendering these video montages, and then watching them as if one movie, inviting default mode network activation and memory reconsolidation.

While this research is still in progress, in experience of the results of these attempts so far I have in fact experienced palpable emotional shifts in my relationship to some particularly overwhelming past experiences.

I intend to continue in this exploration for some more months, then consolidate my reflections and imagery and share the results in an exhibition.

## An example of one method used

With a selection of video files from the last 4 years:

1. Choose a random color channel (Red, Green, or Blue) from 1 frame each of 3 randomly selected videos from the period
2. Output a new RGB video which plays-through each video in its own color channel in a single video montage
3. Degrade, transform, and/or change the colorspace of the final output video

The resulting collages begin to become more abstract to a general viewer, while they remained charged for me with a series of profound suggestions. Additionally, with progressive transformation and decomposition, I found the results increasingly lifted from the personal into something both increasingly abstract and aesthetically captivating.

Most of the results below are from later stages of decomposition, while as you scroll down you will find images that are from earlier in the process. In all cases the images here are screenshots from 30 second - 5 min long video clips:
