summary: "As part of ongoing research I've been experimenting with digital analogs of an alchemic processes to transform my digital archives into something more dynamic, and subjected to the passing of time. In this most recent effort I've processed the images and videos through an algorithmic approximation of the first four stages of that process: burning, dissolving, separating, re-combining, and fermenting."

## Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens

Digital media remains effectively static and unchanged by the passing of time while traditional media patinas, yellows, curls and decomposes in familiar comforting ways.

Approaching my personal digital archive has often felt like a management task, rather than a time of reflection and insight I otherwise wish it to be.

## Current research

I've been experimenting with digital analogs of an alchemic processes to transform these materials into something once again dynamic and re-subjected to the fourth dimension. In this most recent effort I've processed the images and videos through an algorithmic approximation of the first four stages of that process: burning, dissolving, separating, re-combining, and fermenting.

Ultimately the goal is to generate artefacts which effectively honour my past experience while presenting me with with new perspective on those experiences which aid me in integrating them. Through rendering a series of video montages and then watching them as if one movie, encourages default mode network activation and memory reconsolidation.

In experience of the results so far I have in fact palpable emotional shifts in my relationship to some particularly overwhelming past experiences. This project is leaving me with a lot more to explore and think about, and the research is still in progress.

I intend to consolidate the conclusions and resulting imagery to present in an exhibition later this year.

## An example of one method used

With a selection of video files from the last 4 years:

1. Choose a random color channel (Red, Green, or Blue) from 3 randomly chosen single frames of any video during this period
2. Create a new RGB frame with those results, and output that as a new image

Through the random selection of frames from videos spanning the last four years, followed by their recombination, I discovered a result that surpassed mere randomness. Each frame, drawn from various videos, carried a unique charge. While the resultant abstract collages may appear arbitrary or abstract to the viewer, to me, each combination is infused with a series of profound suggestions. This initial exploration has opened a door to a realm where the alchemy of digital media becomes a conduit for meaningful and personal metamorphosis.

Additionally, as I progressively decomposed the rendered videos through various rudimentary means such as random pixel removal, I found the results increasingly lifted from the personal into something simply increasingly abstract and aesthetically captivating.

Below is a collection of single frames from the videos with such methods applied, and at various stages of decomposition.
