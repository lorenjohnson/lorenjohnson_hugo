## Heaven is a place where nothing ever ever happens

Digital media is effectively static and unchanged by the passing of time. Traditional mediums patina, yellow, curl and decompose with time in ways familiar and often revered and comforting. 

## Current research

My personal digital archive has more felt like a duty to oversee and safeguard, rather than a site of deep reflection and insight I otherwise wish it to be. 

As part of ongoing research on this topic I've been experimenting with digital analogs of an alchemic processes to transform these materials into something once again dynamic and re-subjected to the fourth dimension. In this most recent effort I've processed the images and videos through an algorithmic approximation of the first four stages of that process: burning, dissolving, separating, re-combining, and fermenting.

Ultimately the goal is to generate artefacts which both effectively honour my past experience, and present me with new synthesised artefacts which aid me in integrating past experience through promoting default mode network activation and memory reconsolidating. 

So far in experience of the results I have noticed palpable shifts in my relationship to some particularly overwhelming past experiences. The ways some of these experiences now feel woven into my present tense sense is palapable, and reflection the experiences reveals something more settled and inert.

## Recent experiment: Algorithmic collage

With a selection of video files from the last 4 years:

1. Choose a random color channel (Red, Green, or Blue) from 3 randomly chosen single frames of any video during this period
2. Create a new RGB frame with those results, and output that as a new image

Through the random selection of frames from videos spanning the last four years, followed by their recombination, I discovered a result that surpassed mere randomness. Each frame, drawn from various videos, carried a unique charge. While the resultant abstract collages may appear arbitrary or abstract to the viewer, to me, each combination is infused with profound suggestion. This initial exploration has opened a door to a realm where the alchemy of digital media becomes a conduit for meaningful and personal metamorphosis.
