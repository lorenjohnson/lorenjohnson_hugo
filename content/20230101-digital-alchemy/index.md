summary: "As part of ongoing research I've been experimenting with digital analogs of an alchemic processes to transform my digital archives into something more dynamic, and subjected to the passing of time. In this most recent effort I've processed the images and videos through an algorithmic approximation of the first four stages of that process: burning, dissolving, separating, re-combining, and fermenting."

## Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens

Digital media remains effectively static and unchanged by the passing of time while traditional media patinas, yellows, curls and decomposes in familiar and comforting ways.

In part due to this quality and in part to the available tooling, interacting with my personal digital archive has felt more often like management than an immersion in reflection and insight which I otherwise wish it to be.

## Current research

I've been experimenting with digital analogs of an alchemic processes to transform these materials into something once again dynamic and re-subjected to the fourth dimension. In this most recent effort I've been processing my videos through an algorithmic approximation of the first four stages of that process: burning, dissolving, separating, re-combining, and fermenting. 

Ultimately the attempt is to recombine, transform, and re-present the artefacts in ways which aid me in better understanding and integrating the past. I am rendering a series of video montages and then watching them as if one movie, the default mode network is activated and memory reconsolidation is potentiated.

While this research is still in progress, in experience of the results of these attempts so far I have in fact experienced palpable emotional shifts in my relationship to some particularly overwhelming past experiences.

I intend to continue in this exploration for another few months, then consolidate my reflections, and resulting imagery for presentation in an exhibition later this year.

## An example of one method used

With a selection of video files from the last 4 years:

1. Choose a random color channel (Red, Green, or Blue) from 3 randomly chosen single frames of any video during this period
2. Output a new RGB video which plays-through each video in its own color channel in a single video, effectively creating a montage

Through the random selection of frames from videos spanning the last four years, followed by this and other forms of recombination, I found the results feeling not merely random. These juxtapositions of disparate moments in my life were charged, surfacing unexpected associations and suggestions about my past. While the resultant abstract collages may appear arbitrary or abstract to the viewer, to me, each combination is infused with a series of profound suggestions. This initial exploration has opened a door to a realm where the alchemy of digital media becomes a conduit for meaningful and personal metamorphosis.

Additionally, as I progressively decomposed the rendered videos through various rudimentary means such as random pixel removal, I found the results increasingly lifted from the personal into something simply increasingly abstract and aesthetically captivating.

Below is a collection of single frames from the videos with such methods applied, and at various stages of decomposition.
