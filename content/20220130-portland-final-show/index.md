In preparation for a move to Berlin, I closed my studio in Portland in January 2023 with a final show.  The one rule was "if you respond to this piece, and have a place you to put it on your wall, it is yours." The show was co-curated by my son's friends who with my direction dug through everything in my studio and curated and arranged things in a chaotic and adventurous way.

The co-curation and generosity of this occasion punctuated for me the transition from my solo studio work in the direction of the more social art I was relocating to Berlin to pursue.
