Over the past several years, I've crafted a small series of short video poems. My hope is that these video poems serve to bring a tiny tranquil pauseâ€”a contemplative space in the stream of an otherwise hyper stimulating digital landscape Simultaneously, these works serve as a means to honor and elevate moments of utmost significance in my life. They have proven effective in processing my memories and experiences through an artistic synthesis, allowing for a deeper exploration and understanding of the emotions attached to these cherished moments.
