I moved to Berlin last March with the specific intention of exploring a more collaborative art practice. After some initial visits here over the five years leading to that point, I found it to be a uniquely fertile ground for this sort of work.

In November 2023, after settling in and with a few months of planning behind me, I initiated and hosted a four-week co-creative art residency with seven other people. Our goal was to delve into working more closely together, while actively observing and studying any obstacles or limitations that arose during our collaborative efforts.

We agreed to meet every Sunday for four weeks at my home studio. Additionally, there was an optional 15-30 minute call each day, during which anyone in the group could check-in or request support. Independent art practices were honored and supported, and any collaborations that emerged were to be explored and encouraged. I facilitated the first session which included:

* Introduction of Group advisors: I sought the witness and guidance of individuals in my life experienced in group facilitation. Each advisor had an opportunity to introduce themselves to the group via video.

* Orientation Talk: I delivered a brief talk about the origin of the residency idea and how I envisioned orienting our time for the month.

* Group Agreements: I formulated a set of group agreements (attached in links), presented them, and allowed time for questions and discussion.

* Dinner and Sharing: Each participant was given a 10-20 minute window of focused group attention to share openly about their art practice, their aspirations for the residency, and were given the option to lead the in an group activity. I provided a list of possible prompts and activities.

While I'm still in the process of synthesizing the lessons from that period, I can confidently say that things went well.
Here are a few things which do seem quite clear:

- Leadership Dynamics: Initiating a project often leads to unintentionally assuming a default leadership role. Recognising the importance of consensus-building for our Group Agreements, I opted for brevity to avoid overwhelming the group. In hindsight, I acknowledge this decision as a mistake. In the pursuit of a co-creative environment, collaboratively establishing these agreements could have been instrumental. While I don't oppose leadership, I believe that in transitioning towards non-hierarchical interactions, leadership roles should be adaptable.

- Time Constraints: The limited timeframe of four weeks, with meetings only once a week, proved insufficient for us to fully immerse ourselves and root new practices being with each other.

- Mixed Responses: While the majority of individuals responded enthusiastically to the idea of deliberately choosing to work more closely together, I also encountered significant levels of resistance, skepticism, and even confusion as people delved deeper into the concept. There appeared to be an underlying cynicism about such collaborative efforts, which, though not unexpected (I find it within myself as well), surprised me in its proximity to the surface. Despite finding this discouraging, it was also strangely encouraging in revealing that the potential barriers to cooperative flows are perhaps not as deeply ingrained as I might have thought.

- Challenge of Perception: As previously mentioned, I find myself in the ongoing process of comprehending the lessons learned. Despite the sensation that nothing substantial occurred, I am aware that a significant amount did transpire during the period. I am not yet sure why this is, but it feels important to me. 

I am planning to invite another iteration of this residency in coming months.
