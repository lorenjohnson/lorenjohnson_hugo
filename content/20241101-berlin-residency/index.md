In November 2023, after some months of planning, I initiating a 4 week art residency with 7 friends. Coming together to co-create, our objective was to deepen connections and explore the changes and challenges that unfolded in the process. The experience was illuminating, with many insights still in the process of coalescing from this collaborative endeavor.

This venture was spurred by a recognition of the contemporary challenges shaped by the "hyperpresent" fixation, hindering reflection on our past and the active shaping of our futures—a state perpetuated by late-stage capitalism. As Marc Fisher aptly notes, "it is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism," emphasizing the urgent need for a collective shift in perspective.

The pressures of capitalism's "selfish individual" paradigm had also infiltrated my traditionally individualized practice of abstract painting. Despite initially seeking inspiration in crafting intricate personal worlds, the allure of exploring profound emotions on a blank canvas led to a crucial realization. I embraced the belief in more balanced notions of individuality that encourage cooperation and collaboration. This realization prompted my intentional move to Berlin in March 2023, a city where collectives are the norm, fostering an environment supportive of collaboration. My goal is to connect with and nurture this unique setting while it endures, recognizing that our collective intelligence and resilience shine brightest when we collaborate with trust—a vital perspective in these critical times.

It wasn't merely the discomfort of loneliness which led me to this statement. As a painter in the mode of abstract expressionism, I had in fact felt quite encouraged and spurred by the potential of the hermetic depths of world-making I could and felt was my value as an artist. However, it was down this way that I increasingly began to question what was coming-up for me as I entered my studio and looked at a blank canvas. It was not merely the fear of the blankness, but the overwhelm of feelings that felt like an invitation to move towards my most difficult and wounded places and to somehow alchemizes them into art, and ultimately healing. I realized long ago that in the mode of art that healing may need to be secondary, that the suffering I was finding might find its resolution in the glory of being seen, of having brought something of vigour or beauty into the world from my suffering. This agreed with me in principle, but in practice I increasingly found this not actually happening. The recognition I did find was meaningful, and a balm to a sense of isolation, but it didn't really feel like it was hitting the spot of what I had been seeking. 

Over time it became clear that I could balance a lot of this and arrived increasingly at a practice in my art which was in fact often quite nourishing and even magic. However, from this place it became increasingly clear that my next steps wanted the collaboration and perspective of others as much as longed for it. It was the next step.

In my decade as a software engineer the one thing I most missed in working with other artists which seemed applicable from that world was agile process. The fundamentals of that process for me are a minimal structure, but a structure, which focuses on creating time boxed periods of going of moving in a gently defined direction. Then a period to pause and reflect before continuing with the understanding that each step along the way is best discovered at the results of each step, but also, and I think often missed, that each step is completed before evaluated. This for me has proven to provide enough space for speculative journeys, experimentation, while bounding any such open ended process in time to purposely interrupt for period reflection with the implicit invitation to burn it all down and start over if it isn't working. 

I think the primary challenge in modernity is "hyper present" which paradoxically keep us so fixated on the current stimulous that we have no time to pause, reflect, and integrate our past nor participate in the unfolding of our lives into unknown futures. I think this is one of the more opaquely obvious means by which late-stage capitalism is perpetuated. There is simply not enough time to catch it in the act and redirect, and hence the illusion that there is no alternative. I think this is part of what Marc Fisher is pointing to in the oft quote formulation that "it is easier to image the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism". We live at the precipice and its not pleasant nor particularly helpful to look down.
