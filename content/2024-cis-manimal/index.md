summary: "A slow, self-filmed undoing of masculinity through nude movement in the forest—where the body remembers, listens, and begins to unlearn."
---

This ongoing self-filming practice takes place in forested landscapes, often in solitude and often nude. What began as a desire to become more comfortable on camera without an audience has evolved into a deeper inquiry into embodiment, visibility, and the inherited scripts of cis male identity.

Raised among trees and drawn to the forest as a place of childhood refuge, the artist returns to this space not just to be alone, but to reconnect with what he calls “my own most place”—a way of being that feels closer to the body’s truth than most social environments allow. The camera, both companion and future gaze, invites him into a layered choreography of attention: how does one move when no one is watching—and also, when everyone might be?

As a cis man, the work engages with the danger and pleasure of moving outside of permitted masculine postures. It asks what gestures have been denied, what forms of softness or sensuality have been held back, and what becomes possible when they are allowed. In this way, the forest becomes not just a backdrop but a co-conspirator in an act of slow, bodily undoing.

This project is spiritual, erotic, and political—an intimate offering to other cis men and dancers navigating their own internal landscapes. It is not polished. It is muddy, tentative, and animal. And it is listening.
