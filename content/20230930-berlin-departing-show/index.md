Culminating a 3 month visit to Berlin in exploration of what led to my relocation, I started finished a series of expressionistic pieces which I showed from my apartment studio. Everyone that came who felt connected to something on display, and had a place they imagined displaying it in their own space, was encouraged to take the piece. The stated intention was that these pieces would serve as to bookmark my eventual return.
