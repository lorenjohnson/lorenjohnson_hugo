As time has passed, my digital archives have frequently taken on the role of a duty to oversee and safeguard, rather than the wellspring to actively explore and enhance my current life which I think they could be.

Digital media, regardless of the content it encapsulates, possesses a static nature. Perfect in the, "heaven is a place where nothing ever happens," way. This inherent unchanging and impervious quality of digital media is in stark contrast with the dynamic and evolving nature of the lived experiences represented.

In this ongoing artistic research, the aim of this work is to address the stifling density of accumulated digital artefact back into something dynamic. I have been attempting the digital analogs of the alchemic processes of burning, distilling, recombining, and fermenting them to achieve something more distilled and timeless. The ultimate goal once the process is complete is to integrate the results as an aid in personal transformation.

Preliminary results from the initial phase of this research have been intriguing. Through the random selection of frames from videos spanning the last four years, followed by their recombination, I discovered a result that surpassed mere randomness. Each frame, drawn from various videos, carried a unique charge. While the resultant abstract collages may appear arbitrary or abstract to the viewer, to me, each combination is infused with profound suggestion. This initial exploration has opened a door to a realm where the alchemy of digital media becomes a conduit for meaningful and personal metamorphosis.
