## The Insecure Stasis of the Digital

Coherent quote from this: [https://www.arthistoryproject.com/artists/george-ripley/the-compound-of-alchemy/putrefaction/](https://www.arthistoryproject.com/artists/george-ripley/the-compound-of-alchemy/putrefaction/)
-- George Ripley's "The Compound of Alchemy", 1407

Digital media has a static quality. What is stored on our computers or in "the cloud" is just as we leave it, unaltered  and  impervious to time. Meanwhile most of us have at some point experienced data loss or corruption which ordinarily entails not partial but total loss. This juxtaposition of permanence coupled of exact copies with the sceptre of potential disappearance due to sudden and technically mysterious reasons, fosters in the experience of the digital a paradoxical sense of the comfort of perfect record accompanied by the looming insecurity found in the potential of complete loss.

The traditional mediums of paper, film, photo paper, canvas, clay, et al, gradually deteriorate and even when drastically altered by exposure to the elements, something is left of the object which can still be imbued with significance.. Beyond the meticulous concerns of archivists, the yellowing, curling, and brittleness signify the passage of time as a change in state of the artefacts, and the patina on a centuries-old bronze statue aesthetically adds value.

Moving Forward

In this work I reflect upon and challenge the impact of my own digital archive of videos, photos, and writing spanning 3 decades. Many of the thousands of items I store I have not revisited in years, while fastidiously copying them from old computer to new, and maintaining various backups throughout. There is something for of a promise in all of those pixels that one day life will slow and I'll be able to return to moments to both process and savour from the past.  The sense is that I can still extract something meaningful through these pristine portals into my past.

The archaic art of Alchemy speaks of 7 stages to achieving the Magnus Opus ("the Great Work") in this life. In these terms I see the amassed digital archive of my own past as an untransformed material in a state of Calcination moving towards Dissolution. The goal of this work is to move these digital materials through to the next stages of that process, Dissolution, Separation, and Putrefaction (Fermentation). It is a research, an exploration, but also a process by which the unexpected guides the way towards a expected end of integration.
