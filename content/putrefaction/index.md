## The insecure stasis of the digital

Digital media in comparison to what it has superceded it, is hauntingly static. We expect what we store on our computers, or in "the cloud", to be there unchanged and unchanging. Meanwhile most of us have experienced the loss of data at some point, and have the sense that while unchanging, things may without proper backup plans, may suddenly just vanish. This combination of a sense of being impervious to time passing while at once being vulnerable to total loss at any moment, announces a comforitng sense of permanence while diabolically rearticulating familiar insecurity.

Meanwhile the practical effect of the inevitable deterioriation of traditional medium, be it paper, film, photo paper, canvas, clay, et al, is familiar. Outside of the fastidious concerns of archivists, the fading into yellow, curling, and becoming brittle of our personal memorbilia is a marker of time passing. The patina of a centuries old bronze statue a revered aesthic addition.

## Moving on

Such reflections along with a personal awareness of the ways my own personal digital archive haunted me. I have photos and vidoes I have never watched but for a fleeting moment, but have backed-up or concenred myself with keeping for years. I have the sense that there is some value in these things, something which I can still extract by these pristine portals into my past. 

Utilizing the framework of archaic Alchemy as a process of integrating my past. Put in the terms of archaic Alchemy, I began to see the part of me holding onto these digital memories as circulating between Calination and Dissolution. In this project I procssed my video files from the last 4 years of my life through novel means through what the next steps the next stages in the Alchemic process towards liberty from the past: Dissolution and Separation. The somewhat suprising and fascinating results have cleary to me the markers of Putrefactio (Fermentaion), and I think this is where I rest for now:
