summary: "A group-based movement inquiry into how we perform intimacy, care, and connection—challenging fixed roles and exploring fluid, world-building ways of relating."
---

An embodied inquiry into how we organize our intimate lives, this project explores the boundaries between care, eros, friendship, and commitment within the containment of a defined group structure. It questions why certain forms of closeness—especially those linked to romance or sex—are prioritized, while others are neglected, devalued, or excluded from our deepest forms of attention.

Through collective movement practices, relational games, and structured experiments in presence, the research invites participants to explore new ways of being together that challenge dominant scripts. It’s not about performance, healing, or self-improvement, but about co-creating an experience of study—one that treats intimacy as a political terrain.

Influenced by the work of Lauren Berlant, Fred Moten, and bell hooks, the project approaches intimacy not as a private affair, but as a form of world-building. It asks: what becomes possible when we unfix our relationships from rigid roles and allow fluidity, service, and mutual care to guide how we relate?
