summary: "A participatory documentary project inviting ritual, memory, and presence into shared encounters—filmed slowly, simply, in nature."
---

Emerging from a desire to recover the present and re-encounter the past, this ongoing documentary project invites participants—friends, family, and the filmmaker themself—into a shared ritual space in nature. Each encounter is guided by simple prompts and structured time, creating a container for reflection, presence, and co-performance.

The process favors slow shots, minimal camera movement, and carefully chosen locations to emphasize texture over spectacle. It’s less about capturing life and more about composing a moment of mutual attention—a social practice of being with.

This project reaches back toward the spirit of childhood games, offering both participants and viewers an experience that feels simpler, remembered, and more fully connected. It gently loosens the grip of social and gendered scripts, making space for a kind of relating that feels tacitly available—soft, direct, and alive.
